Miscellaneous utils for asyncio.

As a programmer, you are no stranger to the challenges that come with building
and maintaining software applications. One area that can be particularly
difficult is making architecture of the software that using asynchronous I/O.

This is where aiomisc comes in. aiomisc is a Python library that provides a
collection of utility functions and classes for working with asynchronous I/O
in a more intuitive and efficient way. It is built on top of the ``asyncio``
library and is designed to make it easier for developers to write
asynchronous code that is both reliable and scalable.

With aiomisc, you can take advantage of powerful features like
``worker pools``, ``connection pools``, ``circuit breaker pattern``,
and retry mechanisms such as ``asyncbackoff`` and ``asyncretry`` to make your
asyncio code more robust and easier to maintain. In this documentation,
we'll take a closer look at what ``aiomisc`` has to offer and how it can
help you streamline your asyncio service development.

Installation
------------

Installation is possible in standard ways, such as PyPI or installation from
a git repository directly.

Installing from PyPI_:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip3 install aiomisc

Installing from github.com:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Using git tool
    pip3 install git+https://github.com/aiokitchen/aiomisc.git

    # Alternative way using http
    pip3 install \
        https://github.com/aiokitchen/aiomisc/archive/refs/heads/master.zip

The package contains several extras and you can install additional dependencies
if you specify them in this way.

With uvloop_:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip3 install "aiomisc[uvloop]"


With aiohttp_:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip3 install "aiomisc[aiohttp]"

Quick Start
-----------

This section will cover how this library creates and uses the event loop and
creates services. Of course, you can't write about everything here, but you
can read about a lot in the Tutorial_ section, and you can
always refer to the Modules_ and `API reference`_ sections for help.

Event-loop and entrypoint
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

Let's look at this simple example first:

.. code-block:: python

    import asyncio
    import logging

    import aiomisc

    log = logging.getLogger(__name__)

    async def main():
        log.info('Starting')
        await asyncio.sleep(3)
        log.info('Exiting')


    if __name__ == '__main__':
        with aiomisc.entrypoint(log_level="info", log_format="color") as loop:
            loop.run_until_complete(main())


This code declares an asynchronous ``main()`` function that exits after
3 seconds. It would seem nothing interesting, but the whole point is in
the ``entrypoint``.

What does the ``entrypoint`` do, it would seem not so much, it creates an
event-loop and transfers control to the user. However, under the hood, the
logger is configured in a separate thread, a pool of threads is created,
services are started, but more on that later and there are no services
in this example.

Alternatively, you can choose not to use an entrypoint, just create an
event-loop and set this as a default event loop for current thread:

.. code-block:: python
    :name: test_index_get_loop

    import asyncio
    import aiomisc

    # * Installs uvloop event loop is it's has been installed.
    # * Creates and set `aiomisc.thread_pool.ThreadPoolExecutor`
    #   as a default executor
    # * Sets just created event-loop as a current event-loop for this thread.
    aiomisc.new_event_loop()

    async def main():
        await asyncio.sleep(1)

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
        loop.run_until_complete(main())

The example above is useful if your code is already using an implicitly created
event loop, you will have to modify less code, just add
``aiomisc.new_event_loop()`` and all calls to ``asyncio.get_event_loop()``
will return the created instance.

However, you can do with one call. Following example closes implicitly created
asyncio event loop and install a new one:

.. code-block:: python
    :name: test_index_new_loop

    import asyncio
    import aiomisc

    async def main():
        await asyncio.sleep(3)

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        loop = aiomisc.new_event_loop()
        loop.run_until_complete(main())

Services
++++++++

The main thing that an ``entrypoint`` does is start and gracefully
stop services.

The service concept within this library means a class derived from
the ``aiosmic.Service`` class and implementing the
``async def start(self) -> None:`` method and optionally the
``async def stop(self, exc: Optional[ Exception]) -> None`` method.

The concept of stopping a service is not necessarily is pressing ``Ctrl+C``
keys by user, it's actually just exiting the ``entrypoint`` context manager.

The example below shows what your service might look like:

.. code-block:: python

    from aiomisc import entrypoint, Service

    class MyService(Service):
        async def start(self):
            do_something_when_start()

        async def stop(self, exc):
            do_graceful_shutdown()


    with entrypoint(MyService()) as loop:
        loop.run_forever()

The entry point can start as many instances of the service as it likes,
and all of them will start concurrently.

There is also a way if the ``start`` method is a payload for a service,
and then there is no need to implement the stop method, since the running
task with the ``start`` function will be canceled at the stop stage.
But in this case, you will have to notify the ``entrypoint`` that the
initialization of the service instance is complete and it can continue.

Like this:

.. code-block:: python

    import asyncio
    from threading import Event
    from aiomisc import entrypoint, Service

    event = Event()

    class MyService(Service):
        async def start(self):
            # Send signal to entrypoint for continue running
            self.start_event.set()
            await asyncio.sleep(3600)


    with entrypoint(MyService()) as loop:
        assert event.is_set()

.. note::

    The ``entrypoint`` passes control to the body of the context manager only
    after all service instances have started. As mentioned above, a start is
    considered to be the completion of the ``start`` method or the setting of
    an start event with ``self.start_event.set()``.

The whole power of this library is in the set of already implemented or
abstract services.
Such as: ``AIOHTTPService``, ``ASGIService``, ``TCPServer``,
``UDPServer``, ``TCPClient``, ``PeriodicService``, ``CronService`` and so on.

Unfortunately in this section it is not possible to pay more attention to this,
please pay attention to the Tutorial_ section section, there are more
examples and explanations, and of cource you always can find out an answer on
the `/api/index` or in the source code. The authors have tried to make
the source code as clear and simple as possible, so feel free to explore it.


Versioning
----------

This software follows `Semantic Versioning`_

Summary: it's given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

* MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes
* MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner
* PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes
* Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as
  extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.

In this case, the package version is assigned automatically with poem-plugins_,
it using on the tag in the repository as a major and minor and the counter,
which takes the number of commits between tag to the head of branch.

.. _poem-plugins: https://pypi.org/project/poem-plugins
